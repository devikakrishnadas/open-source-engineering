# Open Source Engineering

Being an engineering student, I've often wondered why there isn't a single place that has the complete syllabus of what a typical computer science engineer might need.

There are a lot of resources out there on the internet. This will probably remain to be one of those dusty pages by the corner of the interweb, or atleast just a record to show off my understanding about topics, or maybe just copied and pasted items (with due credits given ofcourse) or maybe just the most popular repository EVER! (a girl can dream).

Let's see what this turns out to be!

Contributions are welcome!

## The topics I intend to put here are:

1. Data Structures
2. Algorithms
3. Networks
4. Operating System

## In each, I intend to have

1. Reference material - `/ref`
2. Freaky super interesting things - `/freaky`
3. Obviously, the actual theory - `/theory`
4. Exercise or Questions - `/exerc`
